Welcome to the digital furnace of Nacarqeqia, a premier, full-stack web application dedicated to disrupting the post-mortem services industry. We leverage state-of-the-art pyrotechnology and a Spring Boot backend to deliver bespoke incineration experiences with dignity, efficiency, and a touch of dark humor.

For our Georgian friends who understand the tale of Nacarqeqia (·Éú·Éê·É™·Éê·É†·É•·Éî·É•·Éò·Éê) ‚Äî the "ash-raker" ‚Äî you know we're not just about the fire. We're about sifting through the remains to find the triumphant spirit within. You get it.
